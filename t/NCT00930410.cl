      The endomicroscopy is an adaptation of traditional optical microscopy in the digestive
      endoscopy. Furthermore, with the integration of a miniaturized laser confocal microscope to
      a videoendoscope, it's possible to study the digestive mucous by \"optical biopsy\". This
      monocentric, non randomized and prospective study uses the Intra-ductal confocal
      endomicroscopy for the characterization of pancreas and bile duct tumor.

      Primary objective:

      Obtain a tissular characterization of a biliary or pancreatic stenosis with a confocal
      microscope which is in direct contact of the stenosis during the Endoscopic Retrograde
      Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Compare the result of this \"optical biopsy\" to a conventional biopsy.
