test IBM blumix (Watson) NLP http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html ./py/.note: 
could make or alter a restful service that was not all alchemy 
want not only caching of final but of intermediate as some things build 
could get local km taxonomys re to the queries
 

Maarten van Gompel @proycon Released CLAM v2.1: Turn your #nlp command line tools into #restful webservices. Please upgrade! https://github.com/proycon/clam/releases/tag/v2.1.0 … 
 CLAM: Computational Linguistics Application Mediator 
 CLAM allows you to quickly and transparently transform your Natural Language Processing application into a RESTful webservice, with which both human end-users as well as automated clients can interact.

=an update of this w/the nlp.lisp 'sp' call or similar: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-dependencies.shtml 
 piping not as standard&since I might want(a cleaner ver of)cachine in dir above, save a file w/in txt, run it, and have output added as the cached version
 could start w/a /tmp/sp.txt file  ;also had the netcat like code around, so maybe set up a service, but unlikely/to be needed at 1st
;when loading nlp.asd noticed prefixp commented out in util_mb I'm using, so there are some diff w/the one on github /resync more sometime
sp2 fnc gives cons tree but skips dependency info and other sentences ;if can get xml/json of this&more, it will be really easy ;look@~lemon encoding
sp_1 gives tree-parse of each sentence, &sp_2 adds the dependancy info for each(just as strings);want2break out into lemon like triples
break out stanford(&berk)parser parts of nlp.lisp and put into sp.lisp
https://site.nlp2rdf.org/ https://github.com/NLP2RDF/ ontologies/tree/master/vm/dep/stanford.{html|ttl} ;grep stanford: stanford.ttl &get into KM form
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/{tree/ | trunktree/rkf-clib.tar.gz} core/text-*.km integrate w/nlp2rdf sp ttl slot hier
 grep stanford: stanford.ttl, then small sed to get: wc sd.km 247  492 6391 sd.km, can make ins of dep types, but keep seperate, maybe w/situations or..
 can just gentemp from the type, top of sd.km will need slots for parts of sentence  ;some of missing files@notional.no-ip.org/km/nl
ln -s components/core cc ls1;cc/*Slot*|sed -f l.sed> ls.cl;ls1 cc/text-*|sed -f l.sed> lt.cl;l.sed: /^/s//(load-kb \"/ & /$/s//\")/
  taxonomy of ls then w/lt, wc: 156     289    4036 then 280     413    6791, as seen in tax.kb from save-kb

http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies_manual.pdf pubs/dependencies-coling08.pdf map dep outputs to taxonomy/slots
Have loaded KM slot-groups, and the core text-*.km files; also have stanford.ttl as a 1st cut hierarchy;not connected,nor the CoNLL(stanford)dependancy
 probably try for CoNLL to KM text-*.km part of it, &see how the stanford.ttl dependancy hierarchy fits in; start by hand &then try assited match
Keep looking for ppl having done this(maybe the ppl doing the lemon work)but not found yet, also look at other re work, a few incl:
also look@ https://github.com/yoavz/EDAN20-lab4  ;other than stanford, installed malt&mst parsers which also have CoNLL output,so can go from any of them
look@km+plm&re:nlp, http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/cyl/krqa07.pdf https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser /not yet
-noticed km pkg problem w/u2.lisp fncs, fixing now, might get bigger cleanup,yes: lkmq using km pkg looking better again but still quirks2iron out
 want to avoid km:: on everything,  export&/or wrap; incl symbol refs, so can avoid on all of them

want to try edg.sf.net HPSG w/KM, but first load done w/ACL, &I want to use SBCL ; could use both to start

look@ https://github.com/eslick/conceptminer & healthminer (w/mallet.cs.umass.edu)
